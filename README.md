Our dataset is information that has been collected on households and individuals 
that have been victimized. There is also datasets from this source that includes nonvictims
but the focus is on victims and crime. This data was collected to show details on vistims and 
the consequences of crimes. It is also used to estimate the types and amounts of 
crimes not reported to police. It is also used to make a uniformed measure for crimes 
and to use for comparison of crimes over time and in different places. The data is 
mostly broken into personal or property crime with subcategories in each. The information 
is collected randomly from a census panel and those on the panel are asked every 6 months 
if they have had a crime commited against them or their household. They stay on the panel 
for 3.5 years but our data set is only for 2020.
